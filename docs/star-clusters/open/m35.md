#### What To Look For Through The Telescope
---

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 40mm or 80mm.

1.	Through the telescope the cluster will appears as a group of individual stars; much like sugar or salt sprinkled on a table top.

## M35 Information
---

1.	The average distance between stars in this cluster is about 1.5 light years.

1.	The luminosity of this cluster is 2,500 times the sun’s luminosity.

1.	This cluster was discovered by Philippe Loys de Chéseaux in 1745-6, and independently by John Bevis before 1750.  When Charles Messier catalogued it, he acknowledged Bevis’s discovery.

1.	M35 can occasionally be seen with the unaided eye as a hazy spot at the feet of Gemini.

1.	M35 is an intermediate-age cluster: it still has many hot, blueish stars, but it also has several cooler, yellow stars.

1.	Through the telescope, M35 has a neighbor, NGC 2158.  NGC 2158 has many more stars, is much more compact, is over 10 times older than M35, and is four times farther away than M35.  Because it’s older, it consists of more yellow stars.
