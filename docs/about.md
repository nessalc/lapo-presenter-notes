## About these notes

In an effort to make Observatory Presenter notes more accessible, the notes left behind by WSU staff have been translated into Markdown (*.md) files and using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), are converted into HTML web-based documentation. Additional notes have been contributed by KAO and volunteer staff at the observatory.

The project is in GitHub and web hooks have been set up to trigger build/deploy using ReadtheDocs.org. Check out the progress here:  <http://lake-afton-presenter-notes.readthedocs.io/en/latest>.  

The pages are themed to support nightvision (red text on black) so that they can be served up directly in the observing room at LAPO ... also, if you have any content suggestions or feedback would be greatly appreciated!!
